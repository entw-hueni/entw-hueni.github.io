# Marty McFly

Martin Seamus McFly is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Back to the Future trilogy. He is portrayed by actor Michael J. Fox.
Marty was born in Hill Valley, California to the McFlys, a family of Irish descent.
Marty McFly is the youngest of three children of George McFly and Lorraine Baines-McFly. He has a brother, Dave McFly, and a sister, Linda McFly. In addition, he has an uncle, Joey, who is serving a prison sentence in 1985 and is denied parole. 

## Marty's Character Traits
* friendly
* brave in the face of danger
* loyal to his family and friends
* pride, which causes him to take unnecessary risks to show others that he is not a coward

My favored quote from Marty:

> Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?
